## ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT notice
Since the last update `v0.2.x` we are experiencing a compatibility issue. This latest version `v0.2.2` is only compatible with Angular v14.x. I recommend using `v0.1.4` as a stable version but, please note that this version uses the previeus icons from Heroicons.com.

Sorry about that, I am working in a big update, I am moving the project to a monorepo to support from Angular v12 to Angular v14 as priority and, after I will work for support for Angular v11 and Angular v10 if needed.

If you have interest to work with some new icon from Heroicons.com, you can copy the full SVG from the page and, use this tool https://icon-lib-builder.dimaslz.dev/ to convert the SVG to an Angular component.
